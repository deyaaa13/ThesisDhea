This Jupyter Notebook contains the experimental results and discussion chapter from my final thesis:
"Optimization of Sentiment Analysis on BMKG National Performance Using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)"

ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Inside:
- Data visualization of sentiment classification results.
- Comparative analysis of SVM before and after PSO optimization.
- Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Tables and plots that showcase the model performance.

ðŸ“Š Key Focus in This Notebook:
- Performance comparison between default SVM and PSO-SVM.
- Effects of PSO on improving parameter tuning for better classification.
- Sentiment distribution insights from real public responses about BMKG.
